## **File Details**

### **1. Classification Reports**
- Contain detailed evaluation metrics:
  - **Precision**: Proportion of correctly predicted positive observations.
  - **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives correctly predicted.
  - **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  - **Support**: Number of true instances for each class.

### **2. Confusion Matrices**
- Provide a visual summary of true vs. predicted labels.
- Normalized percentages make it easier to interpret model performance across imbalanced datasets.

### **3. Training Metrics**
- Loss and accuracy plots help visualize the training progress:
  - **Epoch Loss**: Indicates convergence and overfitting trends.
  - **Epoch Accuracy**: Shows how model accuracy improves during training.

### **4. ROC Curve**
- Measures the model's ability to classify instances across thresholds.
- AUC (Area Under the Curve) reflects the overall model performance (closer to 1 is better).
