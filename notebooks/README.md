## **Usage Instructions**

1. **Setup**:
   - Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. Use the `requirements.txt` file from the repository for easy setup:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Notebooks**:
   - Open any notebook in Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, or VS Code.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook resnet.ipynb
     ```

3. **Data Requirements**:
   - Ensure the raw and processed ECG data (`physionet2017.csv` and `dwt_features_ecg.csv`) are available in the specified directory.
   - Update file paths in the notebooks if necessary.

4. **Reproducibility**:
   - Each notebook is designed to be standalone, allowing you to reproduce results for specific architectures.
